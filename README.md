Jaleen Bowens-Kelly's Portfolio
This is my official Portfolio that I made from scratch using HTML5, CSS3,PHP and JQuery. I have been working on this projects for months, and during those months have refined my methods and programming. The first rendition was sloppy, with many files making it take longer due to lack of organization. My final "rough" draft have taught me a lot about condensing your code and helped improved my organization skills tenfold.
